Hi, I'm **An "Andrew" Huang**, a game programmer.

I got my **Bachelor of Electronics and Information Engineering** in Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019.

I started my career working for a **indie game startup studio** called **Brainagi Games** where everyone had to take on multiple roles. We were using **Unity3D** as our primary engine.

Starting as a programmer, I learned very fast and worked on every aspect of game development (from design to art), and got **a broad spectrum of skills**.

Now, I'm pursuing a **Master of Interactive Technology** degree at Southern Methodist University (SMU) Guildhall. We mainly make games with **Unreal 4**.

I'm also a **Graduate Assistant** for two classes: *Scripting for Level Design* and *Programming for Commercial Game Engines*.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
