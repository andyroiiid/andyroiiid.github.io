Hi, I'm **An "Andrew" Huang**, a game graphics/engine programmer.

I got my **Bachelor of Electronics and Information Engineering** in Huazhong University of Science and Technology. After that, I started my career working for an **indie game startup studio** called **Brainagi Games** where everyone had to be a **generalist**. Our primary game engine was **Unity3D**.

Now, I'm pursuing a **Master of Interactive Technology** degree at Southern Methodist University (SMU) Guildhall, and worked as a **Graduate Assistant** for two classes: *Scripting for Level Design* and *Programming for Commercial Game Engines*. At Guildhall we mainly used **Unreal 4**.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
