There was [a great talk on quaternions at GDC 2023 by Hamish Todd](https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/math-in-game-development-summit-a-visual-guide-to-quaternions-and-dual-quaternions/894472). I stayed in Room 2001 all day with [Prof. Squirrel](http://www.eiserloh.net/bio/) and those talks were amazing. You should definitely check the GDC Vault if you missed them!

This project is still in early stage so there's not much to share, but here are some benchmarks I did.

The benchmarks are done on a Terrans Force AMD 27X7SH1 laptop. Here's the environment:
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor 3.59 GHz
- RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz
- Windows Version: Windows 10 Pro Version	22H2 OS build	19045.2728

Compiler flags impact these benchmark results **A LOT**, and if you force your structs to use 16 bytes alignment (`alignas(16)`), compiler might do **a much better job** at vectorization than your handwritten SIMD instructions.

A big lesson I learnt from this is to **do as many as benchmarks as you can with different compiler flags**.

## Vectors

### Normalization

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| Plain Normalize | 5.1861 ns |
| SIMD Normalize (`_mm_sqrt_ps` + `_mm_div_ps`) | 2.26811 ns |
| **SIMD Fast Normalize (`_mm_rsqrt_ps` + `_mm_mul_ps`)** | 1.19543 ns |

### Cross Product

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| Plain Cross Product | 4.63804 ns |
| **SIMD Cross Product** | 0.840373 ns |

## Matrices

### Matrix Multiplication

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| Plain Matrix Multiplication | 19.6323 ns |
| **SIMD Matrix Multiplication** | 4.29214 ns |

### LookAt Matrix

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| glm::lookAt | 28.2944 ns |
| **SIMD LookAt Matrix** | 1.91781 ns |

### Perspective Matrix

This one is kind of funny because I didn't really do anything SIMD other than using an aligned struct. There might be something wrong with `glm`'s implementation. It could also be me using `glm::perspective` in a wrong way?

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| glm::perspective | 16.4587 ns |
| **SIMD Perspective Matrix** | 1.90413 ns |

## Quaternions

Quaternions are very funny. At first I tought I was doing a fantastic job optimizing with SIMD intrinsics. Then I added `alignas(16)` to those plain quaternion structs, and suddenly the compiler vectorized versions were blazing fast ðŸ˜¥.

My guess is that I was doing too much `_mm_shuffle_ps`. Might need to do some profiling with [AMD uProf](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/uprof.html) later.

### Hamilton Product

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| **Plain Hamilton Product** | 0.240584 ns |
| SIMD Hamilton Product | 1.27795 ns |

### Matrix Conversion

| Name | Average Time |
| --- | --- |
| **Plain Matrix Conversion** | 1.91547 ns |
| SIMD Matrix Conversion | 1.95097 ns |
