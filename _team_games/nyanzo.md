## My Responsibilities

I’ve worked in a mobile game startup before, so that made me the most experienced game developer on the team. Even though we didn’t have a team leader, I was the de facto leader of the team. My roles and responsibilities on the team slightly changed between stages.

### Prototype (Game Designer & Programmer)

- I designed the core swipe & slide gameplay and most of the game elements.
- I wrote the foundation of the gameplay system (the input, the grid movement system, the tile system) 

### Early Development (Level Designer & Programmer)

- I was responsible for designing the last chapter in the main campaign (the buttons & doors chapter).
- The code foundation was very modular, so the other programmer and I can easily split tasks and work independently without any conflict.

### Late Development (Programmer & Level Designer)

- One team lost their programmer so the other programmer on our team moved to help that team.
- I mainly focused on programming during the late development.
