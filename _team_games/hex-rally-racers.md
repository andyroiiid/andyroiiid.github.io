## My Responsibilities

### Gameplay Programmer

- Wrote the base framework of the ability system so that everyone can work on separate ability objects.
- Implemented several pickups.
- Responsible for integrating most visual effects into the game.

### VFX Artist

- Made the development plan for other two VFX artists.
- Authored about one-third VFX in the game (from modelling to textures to Niagara system).

## Gameplay Programming

I made prototypes for about half of the pickups and maintained some of them (about one-third pickups).

## VFX

I worked with other two artists and made [production plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oM2M3r1a8wiw1Xz9ULAQD5pzgjJU9E2jyr8cQtVKWfk/edit?usp=sharing) for VFX.

I also authored some VFX (about one third). Here are some screenshots of my work below.
