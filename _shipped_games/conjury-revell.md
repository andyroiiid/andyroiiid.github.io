## My Responsibilities

## Zipline System

I made the zipline system for the game. The code for this was actually based on the zipline system from my personal project [Strafe](/personal_projects/strafe/). I was the sole programmer for this feature.

### POCT(Proof of Concept Technology)

### Action Block

### The later version that was put into production

Unfortunately the zipline system eventually got cut along with tons of other features.
